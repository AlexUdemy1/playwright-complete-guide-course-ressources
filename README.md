# Playwright - The Complete Guide Course Resources
This repository contains all the code files, snapshots, slides, and other materials used in the Playwright - The Complete Guide course.

If you run into any issues with the code, feel free to ask for help in the courseâ€™s Q&A section.

## Repository Content
Code Snapshots: The /code folder includes various snapshots (starting, intermediate, and final) for different sections of the course.

### Lecture Attachments: 
Any standalone code files or additional materials referenced in the lectures are stored in the /attachments folder.

### Other Resources: 
Additional resources, such as course slides, are available in the /other folder.

Each course section has its own subfolder inside the Code Snapshots and Lecture Attachments folders, making it easy to find the resources for a specific topic.

### Using Code Snapshots
Code snapshots help set up the working environment for the labs. The final snapshots are also useful for comparing your work with the examples from the course. These snapshots come directly from the course recordings and match the code shown in the videos.

You can also run the code snapshots on your local machine. For that you will have to follow the labs and course in order to initialise and run the snapshots.
